## Python Project Template
I made this to simply my python projects while containerizing them without compensating for speed.

### Usage
For Linux or WSL. In the top directory of the project:

1. Run your app or program simply with
    ```sh
    ./run.sh
    ```

2. All the GitHub stuff in one command!
    ```sh
    ./push.sh
    ```
    
    This adds, commits, pulls, merges, pushes, checks out a new branch, and then deletes your fifth oldest local branch in one command.
    Alternatively, `push_simple.sh` does not checkout a new local branch.


`useful_commands.txt` has more information and commands.
